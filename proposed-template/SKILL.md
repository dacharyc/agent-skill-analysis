  Describe what this skill does, when to use it, and key technologies
  it covers. Write in natural prose that incorporates relevant keywords
  organically — avoid bare keyword lists or quoted trigger phrases.
  This description is the primary triggering mechanism — it determines
  whether the agent loads the skill. 50-200 words recommended.

# Skill Title

One-line summary of what this skill enables an agent to do.

## Scope

- [Specific scenario or task this skill covers]
- [Another concrete use case within scope]
- [Include enough detail that the agent can apply the skill confidently]

## Out of Scope

- [Scenario better handled by a different skill or approach]
- [Out-of-scope task that looks similar but isn't]

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command / Pattern | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| [Common task 1] | `command or code` | [When to use, gotchas] |
| [Common task 2] | `command or code` | [When to use, gotchas] |
| [Common task 3] | `command or code` | [When to use, gotchas] |

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: [First Action]

[Concise instruction — 1-2 sentences maximum.]

```language
# Copy-paste-ready code example
example_command --with-real-flags
```

### Step 2: [Second Action]

[Concise instruction.]

```language
# Another complete, runnable example
```

### Step 3: [Third Action]

[Continue as needed. Use numbered steps for sequential workflows,
subsections for parallel concerns.]

## [Domain-Specific Section]

[Add sections as needed for your skill's domain. Use tables for
decision matrices, comparison charts, or option lists. Use code blocks
for patterns the agent should copy. Keep prose minimal — prefer
structured formats.]

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-off |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| [Option A] | [Scenario] | [Pro/con] |
| [Option B] | [Scenario] | [Pro/con] |

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't Do This | Why | Do This Instead |
|---------------|-----|-----------------|
| [Common mistake] | [Consequence] | [Correct approach] |
| [Another mistake] | [Consequence] | [Correct approach] |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| [Error or symptom] | [Root cause] | [Resolution steps] |
| [Another problem] | [Root cause] | [Resolution steps] |
